I drove a racecar 101 miles per hour and was caught on the radar.
Mom and dad came to the station to bail me out.
This is the first time I sped.
It was the worst day of my life.
Even worse, the court relies on the radar.
The (asshole) judge is a nice guy.
He said "I won't it let happen!" before banging the gavel.
